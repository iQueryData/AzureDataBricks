Behavioural Questions :


1. Success Story in Technical ?
Answer : Successfully Implemented Azure Solution of Data Report Extractions from Outlook Attachment, Took Ownership, Initiative, Done the Research 

2. Conflict Handling ?
A : In Developer Discussions, Developers resorts to their Own comfortable Programming Languages Like some would be strong in SQL, some in Python, Some in Shell Script. But i have learned to keep open mind about it. learned to weight pros and cons of choosing one over another before finalising.

3. not able to understand customer requirement ...
A : i had a instance where the customer change the requirements overnight, some would change before the cut-off date. There was a change proposed in a complex pipeline a night before cut-off. But, i have extended hours to accomdate that if that's a very critical change for business to be implemented as part of the release. It's important to understand the need of the customers sometime rather than pushing them back, listen to the queries.

Initiative Taken : 

Outlook Extraction on Reporting : 

Describe : 
Ultimate goal of migrating from existing Alteryx to Azure Cloud Architecture is build a completely automated optimised data pipelines reducing the resource overhead and cost, also - manual interventions. Wells Fargo gets Agency Analytical Data Over Email Attchments, The Problem is APIs, Files Over SFTP, are automated solutions & has in-built tools in Azure DataFactory. However, the Email Attachment extraction has no in-built solution. 

Solution :
i took initiative & ownership to research and find a technical solution to automate the email extraction process. Since, this is Bank - the solution should comply with Core Banking Security Standards & shouldn't compromise security in anyway. I researched everything found a feasbile solution through microsoft graph api & proposed the architecture, design and implemetation plan to the client. Finally, i was able to successfully turn the idea into successfull Deployment in Production.

Some Learning :
i learned not to be scared to propose a solutions that hasn't been implemented before in that organisation. So, There is always a room creative solutions & i learned to implement idea which that comply organisation policies and standards.

i learned to client want to see the benchmark of it rather than proposing a idea and waiting for validations to proceed.

Weakness:

When I propose solutions that have never been implemented before, I sometimes worry about potential failure—what if the solution doesn’t achieve the intended goal or doesn’t meet expectations at some stage? I even wonder about how I would address client concerns if the outcome isn’t as desired.

Weakness Turned Strength: 

That apprehension drives me to be exceptionally thorough. It compels me to conduct in-depth research, meticulously analyze data, and ensure every detail aligns with organizational security standards. By diving deep into every aspect of a solution, I build robust, well-vetted proposals that are more likely to succeed and deliver positive outcomes.
